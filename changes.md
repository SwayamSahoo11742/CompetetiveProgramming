 -  ##### CodeForces round:
    - went really nicely, solved 2 of them with only a couple of ups and down, definitly improving!
    - 1820A: really easy, solved in 30 mins with 0 fails
    - 1820B: Relatively easy, missed an important observation which caused 2 fail, then used int instead of long long which caused 1 more fail

- ##### UTPC 2023 Spring Open:
    - Anime-based and very memey. Wasn't really challenging but I did a few problems and definitly very fun!
    - favorite: UTPC-2023-springC (milking cow problem)
    - bad problem writing though
- ##### Indigo Coding Competition:
    - Extremely well made and very fun. Only got through the first 4 (easy ranked) problem and got frustrated at the fifth (Building Blocks) one even though it was really easy
    - Played Minecraft after the contest with some of the members. Indigo was a really fun place overall.
