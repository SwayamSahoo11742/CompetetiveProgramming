CMIMC ended sad. CMIMC was very fun, the staff were interacting and not professional which I enjoyed very much! It was really fun talking with the people there and sharing strategies at the end. In the test leaderboards I am 7th! lets see what happens in the final grading tommorow. It was relaly fun coming up with strategies for both of them and I really enjoyed them. For auction house, at least I didn't lose to `return 5` also theres no way 
`min(wallet, opp_wallet + 1, history[-1][0] + 1)` did so well :skull:. Definetly look forward to these.

None of us did TwoMaze, but one did L3, the code I will try to get from him. 

ended the day with an easy, humble CF question

Great end to a great break!

Oh its going GREAT! I probably won't be in the top boards but I am having a blast making the ai. I quit on TwoMaze tho. Lebomb James is a very fun question, albeit more complex than Auction House

CMIMC! I probably won't be doing CF problems for the next few days because of this. Found a cool group of people for my group and I'm very excited because I have never done this type of things. I will do Lebomb James tomorrow.

 -  ##### CodeForces round:
    - went really nicely, solved 2 of them with only a couple of ups and down, definitly improving!
    - 1820A: really easy, solved in 30 mins with 0 fails
    - 1820B: Relatively easy, missed an important observation which caused 2 fail, then used int instead of long long which caused 1 more fail

- ##### UTPC 2023 Spring Open:
    - Anime-based and very memey. Wasn't really challenging but I did a few problems and definitly very fun!
    - favorite: UTPC-2023-springC (milking cow problem)
    - bad problem writing though
- ##### Indigo Coding Competition:
    - Extremely well made and very fun. Only got through the first 4 (easy ranked) problem and got frustrated at the fifth (Building Blocks) one even though it was really easy
    - Played Minecraft after the contest with some of the members. Indigo was a really fun place overall.
