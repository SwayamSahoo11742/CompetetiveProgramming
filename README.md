# CompetetiveProgramming
A place for me to put my answers to CodeForces/USACO problems

I love competative programming, and this is where I keep my answers to all the questions that I solve throughout my life. As of right now I'm a cozy little beginner, but soon enough I will rise up the ranks

I'm not sure why you are here, but have a great day!
